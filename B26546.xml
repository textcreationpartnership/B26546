            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>WHo has often with good success remov'd these distempers following, and others too tedious here to name, <hi>viz.</hi> Dropsies, Rumatism, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptions, Agues, and Feavours, Black and yellow Jaundice, all Fainting Swouning and Convulsion-fits, Chollick, Stone and gravell, Excessive Vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, All violent pains and diseases of the Head, Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of vapours, foulness of Stomach, ill digestion, Scurvy.</p>
            <p>As also all distempers in the Eyes, all violent <hi>Rhumes,</hi> and several sorts of <hi>Cataracts,</hi> which I help in a quarter of an hour &amp; restore sight in a moment.</p>
            <p>He hath likewise an Incomparable <hi>Eye-Water,</hi> for Curing all Distempers in the Eyes, and for Strengthning and resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the decayed Sight of People, of what Age soever; You may have this Excellent <hi>Water</hi> of him, and no other, from Five Shillings a Bottle, to what Price you please.</p>
            <p>I perfectly cure the <hi>Morbus Gallicus,</hi> or <hi>French Pox,</hi> therefore I kindly persuade you, that you would be careful of your own Health, now being the best time of the whole year; this Malady being so various in all its symptoms, and lodgeth sometimes in the Head, Shoulders, Arms, or Legs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> so that you may go under a lingering Captivi- for a twelve-month or longer, before you know your own oppressor; therefore as soon as you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb facs="tcp:196021:2"/>these marks, neglect no time, I will prevent the evil from breaking forth, and restore your mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery to perfect Health.</p>
            <p>Those therefore that have receav'd any hurt or harm, need to take dilligent care how the danger doth appear, <hi>viz.</hi> by prick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pains in making Water, Running of the Reins, swelling of the Cods or Groin, Gleeting, Buboes, Ulcers in the Throat or Palat, Scabs in the Face, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all which are forerunners of the <hi>Pox,</hi> and if not well and speedily cured, will certainly turn to that Miseraly <hi>Alamode</hi> Disease.</p>
            <p>Let all those who languish under that miserable distemper (the <hi>Pox</hi> (not be daunted, for tho it were got into your Bones and Marrow, and you left of by Ignorant Pretenders who oftener spoil then cure I will so gently and perfectly cure you that you shall be as sound as a new born child, and never in danger of a Relapse, and so private that no person; nay the Wife or Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band shall not be able to perceive your being in Cure. And if any Persons find themselves not able to take Medicines inwardly, I have a new Invention to Cure them in a short time by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward smoak, never before known in <hi>England.</hi> And for better As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surance, if I do not cure you according to my Promise I will give Bond, or other Security to restore your money Double.</p>
            <p>If any one should chance to have it so far gone, and could not be cured going and standing, I have Extraordinary conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niencies in my house for the Entertainment of any Patient, if necessity requires it.</p>
            <p>But if any one lives distant from this place, they need not come up to me, for I can give them such Illustrious Medicines and infallible directions, that they may cure themselves, except they cannot go and stand with their Illness.</p>
            <p>If any Person that is Ill send their Urine to me, I will satisfy them of the Nature of their distemper, and give them Remedies for the same.</p>
            <p>I Perfectly Cure all <hi>Ruptures,</hi> or <hi>Broken-Bellies,</hi> in either Men Women or Children, particularly at this time of the year, if curable.</p>
            <p>If any Woman be unwilling to speak to me, they may have the conveniency of speaking to my Wife, who is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert in all Womans Distempers.</p>
            <p>My Hours are from Eight a Clock till Twelve in the Morning, and from Two in the Afternoon till Eight at Night.</p>
